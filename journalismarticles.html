<h1> Journalism Articles</h1>

<p>I've had the privlege of being able to explore several areas of journalism, including the business side of the industry. Over the last four years at Medill, I was able to learn about investigating and reporting on a wide variety of events and  stories.</p>

<p>One of the topics I explored was gentrification in two of Chicago's neighborhoods. To download the article, <a href="Journalism 301 - Feature Story-2.pdf">click here</a>.</p>

<p>Another piece I wrote was about the business of journalism. I focused on a specific Chicago-based paper: The TRiiBE. After exploring their business model, analyzing their publications and learning about their mission and vision, my group and I were able to write out a report on how the publication could change their approach to journalism in order to grow their business.
