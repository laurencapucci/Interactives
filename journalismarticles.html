<h1 style="font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 24px; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 25px;">Trends in STD Cases in Chicago and Illinois</h1>

<p> There has been no specific trend identified in changes in sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) cases in Illinois in the last few years; this is likely due to the 2020 pandemic. As shown below, with the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a decline in the number of STD infections with lockdown, which did not pick-up by 2021. It can also be observed that there is a significantly higher number of chlamydia diagnoses compared to gonorrhea and early syphilis.</p>

<p> Despite high numbers of transmission observed in the population of Illinois, STDs seem to affect minority groups more than they do others. For example, despite the population of Illinois being 14% Black, around 40% of individuals diagnosed with chlamydia, gonorrhea or early syphilis are Black. The same trend is observed within the Latinx population of Illinois. </p>

<p> Most diagnoses of early syphilis or gonorrhea were made with male individuals, seem as they are usually more symptomatic with these two illnesses; the same can be said to explain why more females are diagnosed with chlamydia. This comes to show how public health initiatives in Illinois should focus their efforts in also testing those that are assymptomatic to such diseases. </p>

<p> Condom distribution sites seem to be spread throughout the city of Chicago evenly. There are more sites in more heavily-populated ZIP codes, but there are no public health "deserts" observed, which indicates that there is a more equitable approach to distributing condoms for safe-sex practices. </p>

<p> As observed in the figures above, some population groups are more vulnerable to STDs, suggesting that there should be more public health efforts made towards more diagnoses across assymptomatic groups and more initiatives that target minorities, which are impacted more. </p>
