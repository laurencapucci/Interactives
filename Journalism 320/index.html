<h1>About me</h1>

<div class="headers"><h2 id="Section">Introducing Me</h2></div>
<p> My name is Lauren Capucci, and I am a senior at Northwestern University studying journalism and biology. I am originally from Porto Alegre, Brazil, but moved to Evanston a few years ago for school. I am currently on the pre-med track and hope to apply to medical schools soon.</p>

<div class="headers"><h2 id="Section">Hobbies</h2></div>
<p>On the weekends, I like to do a few things for fun in order to relax after a long week at work. Some of my hobbies are: </p>
<ul> <li> Running; </li> <li> Reading; </li> <li> Baking. </li> </ul>
