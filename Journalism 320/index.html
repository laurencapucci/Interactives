<h2 id="Section">Introducing Me</h2>
<p> My name is John Doe, and I am an accountant. I am originally from New Jersey, but moved to Chicago a few years ago. I graduated from the University of Chicago in 2019 as an economics major and decided to stay in the city for work afterwards. I live with 3 friends that I met all college. Our apartment is located in the Loop, which makes it really easy for me to go to work and come back, since it is a walking distance.</p>

<ul> <li> Running; </li> <li> Reading; </li> <li> Cooking. </li> </ul>
